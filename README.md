## Requirements

- LMS version **>=** 9

<br><br>

## What it is and what it is not
The only purpose of *Dark Logic Skin* is to provide a dark-themed version of the *LMS Logic Teal skin* where some UI elements have darker colors.<br>
It's only about the **colors** of the UI elements, **not** about adding or (re)moving UI elements, and definitely not about changing how *LMS Logic Teal skin* works. *Dark Logic Skin* does and will **not** provide any additional functionality beyond that of the *LMS Logic Teal skin*. And some UI elements are not modified.
